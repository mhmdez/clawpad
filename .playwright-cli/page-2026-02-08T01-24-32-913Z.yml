Not because they're lazy, but because traditional apps optimize for streaks and gamification instead of actual conversation skills. We're building something different: a language learning experience that gets people speaking from day one and keeps them coming back because they're actually having conversations, not just completing lessons. Apply now Save Job The Problem We're Solving Most people who try to learn a language quit. Not because they're lazy, but because traditional apps optimize for streaks and gamification instead of actual conversation skills. We're building something different: a language learning experience that gets people speaking from day one and keeps them coming back because they're actually having conversations, not just completing lessons. The Opportunity You'll own the core product experience for Jumpspeak—the app that hundreds of thousands of learners use to gain real conversational confidence in new languages. This isn't about managing a team or attending strategy offsites. This is about shipping features that directly impact whether someone can order coffee in Paris or negotiate a deal in São Paulo. You'll work directly with our CEO and small product team to shape what language learning should feel like. Not through 50-slide decks, but through rapid experimentation, user interviews, and data. What You'll Actually Do Own the Product (not just a feature) You are the DRI for our mobile app experience end-to-end—onboarding, lesson design, conversation practice, retention mechanics Define what success looks like, then build and iterate until you hit it Make the hard tradeoffs between what users say they want and what data shows they need Ship weekly, not quarterly Solve Real Retention Problems Figure out why learners stop showing up and fix it (hint: it's not gamification) Design learning experiences that create genuine progress, not just dopamine hits Balance pedagogical effectiveness with engagement—you can't teach someone who's not there Run experiments on lesson structure, difficulty curves, conversation formats Go Deep on User Psychology Spend serious time talking to users—the ones who love us, the ones who churned, the ones stuck on lesson 5 Understand what makes someone willing to feel stupid while learning a language Design for moments of breakthrough (\"I just had my first real conversation!\") Know your user segments cold: why does a 40-year-old professional learn differently than a 22-year-old traveler? Work Cross-Functionally (But Stay in the Driver's Seat) Partner with engineers to scope what's possible vs. optimal Collaborate with our Head of Creative Strategy to align product experience with acquisition messaging Work with content/pedagogy team on lesson design—you own the experience, they own the curriculum Ship features that growth can actually leverage Use Data, Don't Hide Behind It Analyze cohort retention, feature adoption, session depth metrics daily Run A/B tests on everything—lesson length, conversation formats, UI patterns Know when to trust the data and when to trust your judgment Build simple dashboards that show what's working (and what's dying) Think International From Day One Consider how features work across languages, cultures, learning motivations Design for markets we haven't entered yet Understand that \"conversation practice\" means different things in Tokyo vs. Madrid Work with localization to make experiences feel native, not translated You Should Apply If You Have: 5-8 years in product management, with at least 3 years shipping consumer mobile products Track record of measurably improving retention or engagement metrics (tell us the numbers) Experience at a consumer subscription app or freemium product (you understand the funnel) Comfort writing specs, running experiments, and working in Figma/analytics tools yourself Technical knowledge and experience to communicate and understand fully what the engineering team requires Experience using some Figma or other design tools to effectively communicate what you need Shipped features used by 100k+ people Bonus Points: You've learned a language (successfully or unsuccessfully—both teach you something) EdTech or learning product experience Worked on international products or marketplace dynamics Experience with AI/conversational interfaces Background in linguistics, education, or behavioral psychology You've built for both engagement AND learning outcomes (these often conflict) You Are: Comfortable with ambiguity—we're still figuring out what works Opinionated but not dogmatic—strong convictions, loosely held Willing to be wrong quickly so you can be right eventually User-obsessed but data-informed (not data-paralyzed) Low ego about whose idea ships, high ego about quality Energized by shipping, not by talking about shipping You Should NOT Apply If You want to manage a team right away (that might come, but not day one) You need perfect specs before building You think your job is to write PRDs for others to execute You're looking for a \"strategic\" role (this is hands-on) You want to work on 10 things at once (you'll own 2-3 big bets) You need enterprise software stability (we move fast and break things occasionally) What Makes This Role Different You'll Have Real Ownership This isn't a \"Product Manager 2\" role where you own a button—you own the experience Direct access to CEO and ability to influence company strategy Authority to kill features or experiments that aren't working Your work shows up in the app people use every day You'll Solve Interesting Problems How do you teach conversation without it feeling like a chatbot? What's the right balance between structure and flexibility in learning paths? How do you make someone feel progress when language learning is inherently slow? Can you build one product that works for 18-year-olds and 60-year-olds? You'll Work With Sharp People Small team that ships fast and debates ideas openly Engineers who care about craft and user experience Marketing team that understands product deeply (they're not just pushing ads) Leadership that's built successful consumer products before You'll Actually Impact People's Lives Users send us videos of themselves having their first conversation in a new language Your work helps people get jobs, connect with family, travel with confidence This isn't social media—it's a tool people use to genuinely improve their lives The Uncommon Perks Extreme user access: Talk to users weekly, attend user interviews, read support tickets Fast iteration: Ship small, learn, iterate—not waterfall planning cycles Data transparency: Full access to all product metrics, no gatekeeping Learning budget: We'd be hypocrites if we didn't support your learning goals Language learning: Free Jumpspeak premium (obviously) + budget for tutors/classes Remote flexibility: Work from anywhere, reasonable timezone overlap with team Actual work-life balance: We're building a language learning app, not curing cancer—go live your life What We Care About We're not impressed by: Where you went to school Whether you worked at a FAANG company How many frameworks you can name-drop Your ability to make beautiful slide decks We are impressed by: Products you've shipped that people actually use Problems you've solved with incomplete information How you think about tradeoffs Your ability to articulate why something failed and what you learned Genuine curiosity about how people learn How to Apply Send us: Your resume (keep it to 1-2 pages) A short note (not a cover letter, just 2-3 paragraphs) answering: What's a product decision you made that improved retention? What was the metric change? Why language learning specifically? (If you don't care about this space, this isn't the role for you) Optional but interesting: Show us how you think A feature you'd kill from Duolingo and why A retention experiment you'd run in your first month at Jumpspeak A product that does engagement + learning well (doesn't have to be language learning) We'll respond to everyone within one week. First round is a 30-minute conversation about how you work, not a case study presentation. We're an equal opportunity employer. We don't care about your background, we care about your ability to build great products. If you need accommodations during the interview process, just ask. customize an email to send applying for this job!"

                  - paragraph: Dear Sean,
                  - paragraph: I'm writing to apply for the Product Lead position at Jumpspeak.
                  - paragraph: I learned English as a second language and got it to near-native level. At 21, I started a company to teach others the way I learned. Engleasy was research-led — I designed programs based on second language acquisition theory (TSLA), spent real time in classrooms, trained teachers, and over 10 years we delivered 100,000+ hours of instruction.
                  - paragraph: "My passion has always been education. Recently, with AI advancing the way it has, I started building Studibudi (studibudi.ai) as a passion project — using voice AI to help kids learn through conversation. One thing I discovered early: sessions were great, but kids wouldn't come back. The AI didn't remember anything. Once I added memory — referencing what they learned yesterday, where they got stuck — return rates jumped from around 15% to over 40% in two weeks. The same insight applies to language learning: progress needs to feel cumulative, not episodic."
                  - paragraph: What excites me about Jumpspeak is the focus on speaking from day one. Most apps teach recognition; yours teaches production. I spent a decade learning why that distinction matters, and I'd love to bring that experience to what you're building.
                  - paragraph: I've attached my resume. Would be great to meet and discuss further.

                  - paragraph: The retention focus resonates. At Studibudi, I inherited the classic problem — great first sessions, users vanish. Dug into the data, found that users who got callbacks to previous sessions stuck around 3x longer. Added memory features, return rates went from ~15% to 40%+ in two weeks. I like the puzzle of turning one-time users into habitual ones.
                  - paragraph: I'm also not precious about shipping. I code, I prototype, I run experiments. Built VoiceBench (voice AI evaluation tool) in a week.

Engleasy ran for 10 years. I designed programs based on second language acquisition research, spent a lot of time in actual classrooms, trained teachers. We delivered over 100,000 hours of instruction. Education has been the constant thread through everything I've done."

I added memory that would reference what they worked on before, and return rates went from around 15% to over 40% in a couple weeks. Pretty sure that's the same wall you're trying to break through."
                  - paragraph: "The thing about Jumpspeak that got my attention: you're focused on speaking from day one. That's a fundamentally different product than apps that just quiz you on vocabulary. I spent ten years learning why."
